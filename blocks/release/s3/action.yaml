  Upload artifact's contents to S3 Bucket.

  Requirements:
    - initialized context (actions/context/init)

inputs:
  artifact-name:
    description: |
      Name of artifact to work with. This artifact will be downloaded
      from GitHub, all its contents will be uploaded to S3.
    required: false
    default: ''
  add-version:
    description: |
      Add verison number to all uploaded files.
      If file in artifact has extension (e.g. 'app.zip')
      and current version (from actions/context) is, say, '1.3.0',
      the file in S3 would have name 'app-1.3.0.zip'.

      Files without extension ('myfile') will have version number
      appended ('myfile-1.3.0').
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  add-sha:
    description: |
      Add abbreviated commit SHA to uploaded files.
      If file in artifact has extension (e.g. 'app.zip')
      and current SHA is, say, 'deadfacea6c72ef99d5b11c67973a4b7d5109de9',
      the file in S3 would have name 'app-deadface.zip'.

      Files without extension ('myfile') will have version number
      appended ('myfile-deadface').

      If both 'add-version' and 'add-sha' are 'true', SHA is added to
      file name AFTER version number: app-1.2.3-deadbeef

    required: false
    default: 'false'
  add-os-arch:
    description: |
      Add agent's operating system architecture to uploaded files
      If a file in the artifact has an extension e.g 'app.zip' and the current ARCH is,
      for instance, 'amd64', the resulting file name would be: 'app-amd64.zip.'

      Files without extension ('myfile') will have
      os architecture appended ('myfile-amd64').

      If 'add-version' 'add-sha' and 'add-arch' are true, ARCH is added
      to the file name after the version and sha: 'app-1.2.3-deadbeef-amd64'

    required: false
    default: 'false'

  s3-iam-role-to-assume:
    description: |
      The ARN of a IAM role to assume and configure the Actions environment with
      assumed role credentials.
    required: false
    default: ''

  s3-region:
    description: |
      AWS region with target S3 bucket
    required: false
    default: 'eu-central-1'
  s3-bucket:
    description: |
      Application archive target S3 bucket
    required: true
  s3-path:
    description: |
      Put artifact's files into given 'directory' in
      S3 bucket.

      Files will be uploaded to:
        's3://<s3-bucket>/<s3-path>/<file-name>'

    required: true

  alternative-urls:
    description: |
      Any S3 file with public access could be downloaded from special URL with
      bucket name and region:
        https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<s3-path>

      These URLs are placed to action's outputs by default.

      <alternative-urls> allows to customize URLs for some of the paths by
      applying alternation rules:
        <path> -> <custom URL>

      Example:
        Rule
          ^/cdn/software/ -> https://cdn.milaboratory.com/software/
        will make action to generate URL to cdn.milaboratory.com for any
        file inside /cdn/software/ directory in S3 storage.

    required: false
    default: ''
