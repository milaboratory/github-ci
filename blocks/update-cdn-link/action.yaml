name: Update artifact's link on CDN
author: 'MiLaboratories'
description: |
    This action updates the the CDN link that
    redirect to the latest build results.

    For example, you have a daily build for the development branch
    and you would like to share it with your auditory,
    and at the same time, you don't want to upload your results twice,
    by uploading build results and re-writing the latest archive on the s3 bucket.
    Thus this action will come in handy just creating
    a zero-byte object that redirects the user to actual build results.
