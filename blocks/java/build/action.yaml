description: |
  Build Java project with gradle.

  This action cares about caching and re-using build results and
  uploading selected build results into GitHub Actions artifacts storage.

  Requirements:
    - initialized context (actions/context/init)

inputs:
  #
  # Build control
  #
  project:
    description: |
      Gradle project name to build _without_ task name:
        gradle :<project>:<task>
      For 'root' project just leave input empty

    required: false
    default: ''

  project-dir:
    description: |
      Path to project root directory.
      Defaults to repository root.
    required: false
    default: './'

  tasks:
    description: |
      Gradle build tasks.
      You can put several tasks here (one per line).
      Each task will be prefixed with <project> name:
        gradle :<project>:<task>

    required: false
    default: build

  exclude-tasks:
    description: |
      Tasks to skip (--exclude-task options).
      You can put several tasks here (one per line).
      Each task will be prefixed with <project> name:
        gradle :<project>:<task>

    required: false
    default: ''

  custom-arguments:
    description: |
      Custom arguments for gradle command.
      Each line is considered as single argument:
          '-b <file>'
        on single line will cause error. Put
          '-b
           <file>' to get what you want.

    required: false
    default: ''

  #
  # Environment control
  #
  java-version:
    description: |
      Version of JAVA to use for build.

      Empty value makes action to skip environment preparation step.
    required: false
    default: ''

  java-distribution:
    description: |
      Java distribution to use.
      Example: 'temurin', 'zulu', ...
      See 'https://github.com/actions/setup-java#supported-distributions'
      for complete list of supported distributions.
    required: false
    default: 'temurin'

  properties:
    description: |
      Contents for '~/.gradle/gradle.properties' to be set before gradle command run.

      Empty value makes actions to keep '~/.gradle/gradle.properties' file intact.
    required: false
    default: ''

  gradle-cache-key:
    description: |
      Key to use for gradle build cache, shared across builds in single repository.
    required: false
    default: ''

  data-cache-key:
    description: |
      Key to use for custom build data caching.

      Both <data-cache-key> and <data-cache-paths> are
      required for feature to work.

      Some builds produce project-specific data as a build result,
      This data can be re-used in subsequent builds.
    required: false
    default: ''

  data-cache-paths:
    description: |
      Additional paths to cache between runs.

      Both <data-cache-key> and <data-cache-paths> are
      required for feature to work.

      Some builds produce project-specific data as a build result,
      This data can be re-used in subsequent builds.
    required: false
    default: ''

  #
  # Artifact control
  #
  artifact-name:
    description: |
      Name of build artifact to create when <artifact-paths> input is not empty

    required: false
    default: 'build-artifacts'

  artifact-paths:
    description: |
      List of paths to artifacts to save after build run.
      Empty list disables artifacts upload.

      Relative paths are relative to gradle 'buildDir' project's property.
      Absolute paths (starting with '/') are relative to repository root.
      Patterns ('*', '**', etc.) are supported.

    required: false
    default: ''

  artifact-retention:
    description: |
      Time in days to keep build artifacts before removing them
    required: false
    default: '7'
