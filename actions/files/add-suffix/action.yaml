name: Add given suffix to all listed files
author: 'MiLaboratories'
description: |
  Rename all <paths> by adding <suffix> to their names

  File extension is taken into account:
    - if file has extension (e.g. 'app.zip') and suffix
      is '-1.3.5', the file would be renamed to 'app-1.3.5.zip'.
    - if file has no extension, (e.g. 'datafile'), the suffix
      is appended to the name: datafile-1.3.5

inputs:
  paths:

      Paths to files to rename.
      When directory is pointed, all files in directory will be
      renamed recursively. Directories will not be renamed.
