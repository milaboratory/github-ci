name: Detect application version
author: 'MiLaboratories'
description: |
  This action tries to get current code version from git tags:
    * When git tag directly points to the current commit, it is used as
      current version number (v-prefix is trimmed)
    * When no git tag for current commit was found, the version number is
      generated with the following template: '<prev vesrsion>-<branch name>-<ahead commits count>'
      E.g. when the latest tag in repo is v1.3.2 and 'master' branch is ahead of that tag
      by 3 commits, the version for 'master' would be: 1.3.2-master-3

  The action does not mutate any files in repository or affect application builds.
  It only sets outputs the user can then pass to other workflows/jobs/steps.

inputs:
  branch-versioning:
    description: |
      Put a branch name here to activate simple branch versioning mode:
        - 'current-version' is always "<GitHub Run Number>-<short commit hash>";
        - 'is-release' is true only for runs from <branch-versioning> branch;
        - '*-tag' is always empty;
        - 'previous-sha' and 'latest-sha' are always 'unknown';
        - 'is-latest-version' is true for runs from HEAD of <branch-versioning> branch;
        - 'is-latest-major' is always equal to 'is-latest-version';

  fetch-depth:
    description: |
      The number of commits of git history from current HEAD to fetch
    required: false
    default: '200'
  canonize:
    description: |
      Canonize version number to make it always look like regular semver: '<major>.<minor>.<patch>'.
      This makes git tag 'v1.1' to produce version '1.1.0' instead of '1.1'.
    required: false
    default: 'false'

outputs:
  current-version:
    description: |
      Version number read from git tags
  current-tag:
    description: |
      Tag used for version detection 'as-is'
  current-sha:
    description: |
      Full hash of git commit the version belongs to
  previous-version:
    description: |
      Previous version number read from git tags
  previous-tag:
    description: |
      Previous version tag 'as-is'
  previous-sha:
    description: |
      Full hash of git commit the previous version belongs to
  latest-version:
    description: |
      The latest version number we could read from git tags
  latest-tag:
    description: |
      The latest version tag 'as-is' (sorted as version numbers)
  latest-sha:
    description: |
      Full hash of git commit the latest version belongs to
  is-release:
    description: |
      Checks if current version is release version (current commit has some tag).
  is-branch-head:
    description: |
      Checks if remote version of current branch points to the same SHA as local.

      This can be used to detect old workflow restarts when needed, for example
      to prevent :latest docker image tag from being replaced by old workflow.
  is-latest-version:
    description: |
      Checks if current version is latest of all known versions
      (detected by tags in repository)
  is-latest-major:
    description: |
      Checks if current version is the latest modification of the major version.
      E.g. for list of versions
        1.4.0
        1.4.2
        2.0.1
      'is-latest-major' would be 'true' for 1.4.2 (the latest known v1)
      and 2.0.1 (the latest known v2)

runs:
  using: 'node20'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
