name: Simplifies environment setup in called workflows
author: 'MiLaboratories'
description: |
  This action is designed to simplify environment variables
  setting through workflow inputs.
  When calling reusable workflows GitHub does not allow to
  patch workflow jobs from the caller side. If you set default
  environment variables in parent (caller) workflow (in the project's
  repository), this variables will not be set in called workflow.

  The only way to control environment variables inside jobs from 'outside'
  is to add special steps with environment setting to all jobs where we need
  such control.

  In addition, when calling reusable workflow, caller can't put secrets
  to called workflow inputs, only to secrets. At the same time, secrets
  are masked, this makes actions debugging a bit less comfortable when
  you face run-time problems.

  This action helps in variables setting from both input and secrets
  in single action call
