  Put data into context so other jobs can read it later.
  Consider context as key-value store with immutable values.
  Once stored under specific key, the value can not be changed.

  NOTE: for large files use 'cache' GitHub Actions functionality
        as 'context' is based on 'artifacts' and is slow on big files.

inputs:
  key:
    description: |
      The key to use for value storage.
      The value could be retreived from context by this key.
    required: true

  value:
    description: |
      The value to store under key.
    required: true
